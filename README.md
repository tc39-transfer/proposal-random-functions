# Random Namespace and Functions

Historically, JS has offered a very simple API for randomness: a `Math.random()` function that returns a random value from a uniform distribution in the range [0,1), with no further details. This is a perfectly adequate primitive, but most actual applications end up having to wrap this into other functions to do something useful, such as obtaining random *integers* in a particular range, or sampling a *normal* distribution. While it's not hard to write many of these utility functions, doing so *correctly* can be non-trivial: off-by-one errors are easy to hit even in simple "simulate a die roll" cases.

This proposal introduces a number of convenience functions for dealing with random values, to make common random-related use-cases easier to use. It groups all of these under a new namespace object - `Random` - for convenience and ease of understanding.

Goals:
* To introduce at least the lowest common set of functionality for generating random numbers
* To build a consistent and easily understood API

Applications currently outside the scope of this proposal:
* Random string functions
* Specialised probability functions
* Iterator/Generators

Anything on this list would ideally require a libray or separate proposal.

## Details

This proposal suggests that all new Random-related functions be accessible from a global `Random` namespace.

This does not impact either the Crypto methods or Math.random, which would remain as-are.


## Example methods

### Single randoms
|Function           | Description|
|-------------------|------------|
random()            | return a random decimal value in the range [0,1) |
numberBetween( x, y )  | return a random value between x and y         |
integerBetween( x, y ) | return a random integer between x and y       |
boolean()           | randomly returns either true or false             |

### Lists of randoms
|Function                    | Description|
|----------------------------|------------|
randomList( size )               | return a `size` sized list of decimal values in the range [0,1)  |
numberBetweenList( size, x, y )  | return a `size` sized list of random values in the range [x,y)   |
integerBetweenList( size, x, y ) | return a `size` sized list of random integers in the range [x,y) |
booleanList( size )              | return a `size` sized list of random boolean values              |

### array methods
|Function             | Description|
|---------------------|------------|
pickFromList( array ) | return a random element from [0,array.length) (can be undefined for empty/sparse arrays) |
shuffle( array )      | perform an in-place random shuffle of the array                                          |
asShuffled( array )   | return a copy of the the provided array with the elements randomly shuffled              |



### Some open questions

How and when to clamp input values of Â±Infinity.

Should integers for range (x,y) be generated as [x,y) or \[x,y\]?

How should integers be generated when passed non-integer boundaries?


## Interaction With Other Proposals

It is intended that this proposal and the [Seeded Random proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-seeded-random/) expose the same APIs. Either proposal can advance ahead of the other, however. This proposal is intentionally not touching seeded randomness, instead focusing on functions that are agnostic as to their random source.
